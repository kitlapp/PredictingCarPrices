# mlr_car_price
This project focuses on predicting car prices using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR).

This is my first ever completed project. Specifically, I performed Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Selection, Feature Engineering, Model Assumption Examinations, and Machine Learning (Multiple Linear Regression - MLR). The dataset was provided from an online course (for more info about this course, read my previous README files).

What I gained from this project?
The most valuable part of this project, in terms of practicing my skills, was at its end, i.e., after making the predictions with the model. Hereâ€™s what I learned and plan to do next:
1) Guide for MLR Model Checks  
It would be beneficial to create a detailed guide with steps to check the predictions of MLR models. For example, "Step 3: Make a scatter plot of Predictions vs. Residuals to check if there is any pattern in the residuals. If there is no specific pattern, this is a good indicator for your model."
2) Creating Utility Functions  
Having completed this project at a somewhat advanced level, I realized it would be useful to develop a new project including custom functions. These functions can help speed up and organize future work, not only in Machine Learning but in Data Science in general.
3) Model Improvement and Comparison  
I want to try improving this model by further feature selection, feature engineering, etc., and compare the results with the current model. This will help me understand how adjustments in features and other parameters influence metrics like the adjusted R-Squared.
4) Rethinking 'Difference %'  
I questioned the usefulness of the 'Difference %' column in df_comparison. It seems to underestimate the percentage difference if the prediction is less than the actual price and overestimates it if the prediction is greater. Creating a function with more comprehensive metrics might provide a clearer picture of predictions, avoiding the misleading conclusions this single column might lead to.
5) Understanding ML Model Results  
Implementing a Machine Learning model might be straightforward, but fully understanding its results and making improvements is the real challenge.
6) Prepared Dataset for Further Analysis  
I exported a cleaned DataFrame that includes all the features from the original raw data. This dataset can be used for extensive model checks, comparisons, and statistical tests in future projects.

Thank you!
